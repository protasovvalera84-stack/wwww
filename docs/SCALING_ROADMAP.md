# NexaLink Scaling Roadmap: 1 → 1,000,000,000 Users

## Current State (2024)
- **Users:** ~10
- **Server:** 1 VPS (72.56.244.207)
- **Stack:** Synapse + PostgreSQL + Nginx + Docker
- **Cost:** ~$20/month

## Phase 1: 1,000 Users
**Timeline:** Now  
**Cost:** $20-50/month

### What's needed:
- [x] Code splitting (done)
- [x] IndexedDB cache (done)
- [x] Rate limiting (done)
- [x] DDoS protection (done)
- [ ] Synapse worker mode (2-3 workers)
- [ ] PostgreSQL connection pooling (PgBouncer)
- [ ] Redis for session cache

### Server requirements:
- 4 CPU, 8 GB RAM, 100 GB SSD
- Single server is sufficient

---

## Phase 2: 10,000 Users
**Timeline:** +3 months  
**Cost:** $100-300/month

### What's needed:
- [ ] Synapse workers: 5 (federation, sync, media, client, push)
- [ ] Redis cluster (sessions + cache)
- [ ] S3-compatible storage for media (MinIO or Wasabi)
- [ ] CDN for static assets (Cloudflare free tier)
- [ ] Automated backups to remote storage
- [ ] Prometheus + Grafana monitoring
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions)

### Architecture:
```
Load Balancer (Nginx)

- [ ] Push notification service (FCM/APNs)
- [ ] Email service (transactional emails)
- [ ] Rate limiting per user (not just per IP)
- [ ] Content moderation (AI-based)

### Architecture:
```

## Phase 4: 1,000,000 Users
**Timeline:** +12 months  
**Cost:** $10,000-30,000/month

### What's needed:

- [ ] Dedicated media processing pipeline
- [ ] Real-time analytics (ClickHouse)
- [ ] A/B testing infrastructure
- [ ] Feature flags system
- [ ] Dedicated security team
- [ ] SOC 2 compliance

### Architecture:
```

## Phase 7: 1,000,000,000 Users
**Timeline:** +5-7 years  
**Cost:** $50,000,000+/month

### What's needed:
- [ ] 10+ data centers worldwide
- [ ] Custom hardware (like Google/Facebook)
- [ ] Own CDN network
- [ ] AI/ML at every layer
- [ ] 1000+ engineers
- [ ] $1B+ annual infrastructure budget

### Reference (what others spend):
| Company | Users | Infra Cost/Year |
|---------|-------|-----------------|
| Telegram | 900M | ~$500M |
| WhatsApp | 2B | ~$1B (Meta) |
| WeChat | 1.3B | ~$2B (Tencent) |
| Facebook | 3B | ~$30B |

## Key Decisions at Each Stage

| Users | Key Decision |
|-------|-------------|
| 1K | Stay on Matrix or build custom? |
| 10K | Self-hosted or cloud? |
| 100K | Monolith or microservices? |
| 1M | Own protocol or keep Matrix? |
| 10M | Build own team or outsource? |
| 100M | Own data centers? |
| 1B | IPO / major funding required |

## Recommendation for NexaLink

**Short term (now → 10K users):**
- Stay on Matrix/Synapse (proven, federated)
- Add Synapse workers for scaling
- Move media to S3
- Add Redis cache

**Medium term (10K → 1M users):**
- Kubernetes deployment
- Consider custom backend (keep Matrix protocol for federation)
- Elasticsearch for search
- Native mobile apps

**Long term (1M+ users):**
- Custom protocol (faster than Matrix)
- Microservices
- Own infrastructure
- Significant funding required ($10M+)
